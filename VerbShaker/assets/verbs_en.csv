A cat|may look at a king
A chain|is only as strong as its weakest link
A change|is as good as a rest
A dog|is a man's best friend
A drowning man|will clutch at a straw
A fish always|rots from the head down
A fool and his money|are soon parted
A friend in need|is a friend indeed
A golden key|can open any door
A good beginning|makes a good ending
A good man|is hard to find
A house divided against itself|cannot stand
A house|is not a home
A journey of a thousand miles|begins with a single step
A leopard|cannot change its spots
Two wrongs|don't make a right
The pen|is mightier than the sword
When in Rome|do as the Romans
The squeaky wheel|gets the grease
No man|is an island
Fortune|favors the bold
People who live in glass houses should not|throw stones
Birds of a feather|flock together
A picture|is worth a thousand words
The early bird|catches the worm
